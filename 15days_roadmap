🎯 Goal: Master Java OOPs concepts with hands-on practice and interview readiness
🕒 Duration: 15 Days | 💻 Focus: Concepts + Coding + Interview Prep
🔖 LEGEND
📘 = Theory | 🧠 = Concept Practice | 🧪 = Hands-on Coding | 🎤 = Interview Prep | 🎯 = Optional for Projects

🗓️ Day 1 – Java Basics Refresher + OOPs Intro
📘 What is Java, JVM, JRE, JDK
📘 Hello World + Compilation
📘 What is Object-Oriented Programming?
🧠 Real-world analogies (Person, Car, Animal)
🧪 Create a basic class + object (e.g., Dog class)

🗓️ Day 2 – Classes, Objects & Constructors
📘 Class, Object, Constructor, Constructor Overloading
🧪 Create Student, Book, or Product classes with multiple constructors
🎤 Q: What is the use of constructors in Java?

🗓️ Day 3 – Inheritance
📘 Types of inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical – no multiple with classes)
📘 super keyword
🧪 Create a Vehicle → Car → ElectricCar example
🎤 Q: Why does Java not support multiple inheritance with classes?

🗓️ Day 4 – Polymorphism
📘 Compile-time (Overloading) & Runtime (Overriding)
🧠 Method Signature Rules
🧪 Write overload and override examples
🎤 Q: What is dynamic method dispatch?

🗓️ Day 5 – Abstraction
📘 Abstract Class vs Interface
📘 When to use which?
🧪 Create abstract class Animal and implement in Dog, Cat
🎤 Q: Can we create an object of an abstract class?

🗓️ Day 6 – Interface Mastery
📘 Interface syntax, multiple inheritance using interfaces
📘 Default & static methods in interfaces
🧪 Create PaymentGateway interface implemented by Paytm, GPay, etc.
🎤 Q: Interface vs Abstract Class (differences and examples)

🗓️ Day 7 – Encapsulation & Access Modifiers
📘 Getters and Setters
📘 Public, Private, Protected, Default
🧪 Make a BankAccount class encapsulated
🎤 Q: Why is encapsulation important?

🗓️ Day 8 – Static, Final, this, super
📘 static, final, this, super keywords
🧪 Create examples to show difference
🎤 Q: What is the use of static methods in Java?

🗓️ Day 9 – Inner Classes & Packages
📘 Member class, Static nested, Anonymous, Local
📘 Package creation, import
🧪 Create a class with nested class, and use in a package
🎤 Q: Use cases of inner classes?

🗓️ Day 10 – Real-World Project OOPs Design
🎯 Choose a mini system: Library / Employee / Course Registration
🧪 Design full classes, attributes, inheritance
🎤 Q: Explain OOPs used in your mini project

🗓️ Day 11 – Practice Java OOPs Coding
🧠 HackerRank: 10 Days of Java
🧪 LeetCode: Easy level OOPs-related questions
🎤 Prepare answers for: Object vs Class, Overriding rules, Constructor types

🗓️ Day 12 – Interview MCQs + Java Edge Topics
📘 Wrapper classes, Autoboxing
📘 Object class methods: equals(), toString(), hashCode()
🧪 Practice questions from Java MCQ sets
🎤 Practice explaining: hashCode & equals

🗓️ Day 13 – Mock Interview 1
🎤 Simulate interview:

Tell me about OOPs

Explain polymorphism with example

Write code for inheritance and overriding
🧪 Time your code writing: < 10 mins each

🗓️ Day 14 – Mock Interview 2 + DSA OOPs
🎤 Simulate interview with DSA context:

How will you implement Stack using OOPs?

What OOPs concept fits binary tree traversal?

🧪 Implement Stack and Queue with Java classes

🗓️ Day 15 – Review & Resume Prep
📘 Revise ALL concepts
🎯 Update resume with:

OOPs project

Java proficiency
🎤 Rehearse:

"Tell me about yourself"

Project + OOPs explanation

🧾 Optional Extras
Add GitHub Repo for your mini project

Use UML diagrams to show class relationships

Practice system design using OOPs
